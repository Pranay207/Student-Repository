- Use filters to manage complexity
- Display only essential information by default
- Provide "Show More" options for details

**Dashboard Layout Example**:
```
Top Section (Always Visible):
- Overall GPA
- Upcoming deadlines (next 3)
- Current course progress

Middle Section (Scrollable):
- Recent grades (last 5)
- This week's assignments
- Performance trends (1 chart)

Bottom Section (Expandable):
- Detailed statistics
- Historical data
- Advanced analytics
```

#### 2. Targeted Information Delivery

**5-Second Rule**: Users should grasp the most important data within 5 seconds.

- Consistent placement across pages

#### 4. Purposeful Menu Structures

**Principles**:
- Reflect pedagogical goals
- Avoid generic "resource dumps"
- Organize by user tasks, not system structure
- Limit menu depth to 2-3 levels

**Example Structure**:
```
Main Navigation:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dashboard (Home)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Grades
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Current Semester
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Grade History
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Assignments
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Upcoming
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ In Progress
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Completed
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Calendar
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Settings
```

#### 5. Meaningful Labels and Micro-copy

**Principles**:
- Align with student mental models
- Use language students understand
- Provide context where needed
- Be concise but clear

**Examples**:
```
‚úÖ Good:
- "Add Your Grade" (clear action)
- "Assignments Due This Week" (specific timeframe)
- "Your Progress" (personal, relevant)

‚ùå Avoid:
- "Input Data" (too technical)
- "Pending Items" (vague)

  full_name VARCHAR(255),
  grade_level VARCHAR(50),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**subjects**
```sql
CREATE TABLE subjects (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  color VARCHAR(7), -- Hex color code
  target_grade DECIMAL(5,2),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**grades**

  assignment_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  grade_received DECIMAL(5,2) NOT NULL,
  grade_possible DECIMAL(5,2) NOT NULL,
  percentage DECIMAL(5,2) GENERATED ALWAYS AS (
    (grade_received / grade_possible) * 100
  ) STORED,
  weight DECIMAL(5,2) DEFAULT 1.0, -- For weighted grades
